myQuant provides a pricing tool for simple and complex financial products such as Bonds and Swaps. Usually these tools
are reserved to investment banks. myQuant tries to bring this service to everyone, for free.
Any great tool should come with a great documentation. I have written the User Guide, as clear and understandable as
possible, so you could fully benefit from the features of myQuant. The most important point is the Parsing function to
import Quotes from a text file. You also have a quick reminder of the instruments, and the description of each page of
the calculator.
myQuant doesn’t provide the Market Data. Which is usually quite expensive. You will need to have a data provider such
as Reuters, Bloomberg and SuperDerivatives. Once you have the Market Data, you are ready to use myQuant.
It is mandatory to accept the “Terms and Conditions” before using the website. You should remember that “Material on
this website is provided for general information purposes only and your use of the material is at your own risk”, and also
“myQuant does not accept any liability for any loss or damage”. myQuant is not associated with any financial
institutions, data providers or other entities
